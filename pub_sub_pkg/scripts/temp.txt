	Whenever the subscriber gets a msg, the callback function runs, just
	like timers. The msg object created is local to the callback function.
	This is why it is important to use classes for inter function message
	exchange. The use of global variables for the same purpose should be
	avoided, As usage of global variables are looked down upon in larger
	code bases due to collisions.
